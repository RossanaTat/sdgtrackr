\usage{
project_path_speed(
  data_his,
  speedseq = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4),
  path_speed,
  floor = 0,
  ceiling = 100,

}
\arguments{
\item{data_his}{A `data.table` containing historical values with variables `code`, `year`, and `y_his`.}

\item{speedseq}{numeric vector of speed paths to calculate}

\item{granularity}{A numeric value indicating the step size used when
computing the trajectory over time. Smaller values produce smoother curves.
Defaults to \code{0.1}.}

\item{eval_from}{The first year to include in the analysis}

\item{eval_to}{The last year to include in the analysis}

\item{min}{A numeric value indicating the minimum bound,
typically passed from a previously processed dataset (e.g., `prep_data()` output via `min <- data_model$min`).
This value is stored as an attribute of the returned object for later reference (e.g., in visualizations or simulations).}

\item{max}{A numeric value indicating the maximum bound,
typically passed from a previously processed dataset (e.g., `prep_data()` output via `max <- data_model$max`).
This value is stored as an attribute of the returned object for later reference (e.g., in visualizations or simulations).}

\item{best}{A character string indicating the direction of improvement.
Use \code{"high"} (default) if higher values of the indicator are better,
or \code{"low"} if lower values are better. This affects the direction of the path.}
}
\value{
A data frame of projected values under different speeds
}
\description{
Calculates path a country would have taken with various speeds
}
