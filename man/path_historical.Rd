\arguments{
\item{percentiles}{Logical. If TRUE, calculate percentile scores. Default is TRUE}

\item{speed}{Logical. If TRUE, calculate speed of progress scores.
Default is FALSE}

\item{data_his}{A data.table containing historical values.}

\item{eval_from}{First year to include in projections.}

\item{eval_to}{Last year to include in projections.}

\item{granularity}{Numeric. Granularity in outcome variable. Default is `0.1`.}

\item{min}{Optional. Minimum value of `initialvalue` to predict.}

\item{max}{Optional. Maximum value of `initialvalue` to predict.}

\item{best}{A character string indicating the direction of improvement.
Use \code{"high"} (default) if higher values of the indicator are better,
or \code{"low"} if lower values are better. This affects the direction of the path.}

\item{sequence_pctl}{Percentiles to calculate. The percentile score assigned is determined by the granularity of the percentiles selected here. I.e., if seq(20,80,20) is selected, then we will be able to tell if a country is between 0-20, 20-40, etc.}

\item{changes_pctl}{A `data.table` with predicted changes by initialvalue and pctl.}

\item{sequence_speed}{Numeric vector of speed paths to calculate}

\item{path_speed}{Data table  with xxx}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print progress messages (only used in percentile projection).}
}
\value{
A named list with one or both of `percentile_path` and `speed_path`.
