\usage{
future_path_speed(
  data_fut,
  sequence_speed = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4),
  path_speed,
  best = "high",
  target_year = 2030,
  min = 0,
  max = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_fut}{A data frame or data table containing the historical and/or
baseline data. Must include columns: `code`, `year`, and `y` (the indicator),
and optionally `y_fut` and `time` for projections.}

\item{best}{A character string indicating the direction of improvement.
Use \code{"high"} (default) if higher values of the indicator are better,
or \code{"low"} if lower values are better. This affects the direction of the path.}

\item{target_year}{An integer specifying the year to project to. Default is `2030`.}

\item{min}{Optional. Minimum value of `initialvalue` to predict. If `NULL`,
it is set to `floor` (if provided) or `min(data_model$initialvalue)`.}

\item{max}{Optional. Maximum value of `initialvalue` to predict. If `NULL`,
it is set to `ceiling` (if provided) or `max(data_model$initialvalue)`.}
}
\value{
A data table with projected indicator values (`y_fut`) for each
  country-year-speed combination from the last available year through
  the `target_year`, respecting the selected progress speeds and
  indicator direction (`best`).
}
\description{
This function simulates future indicator trajectories under different
speeds of progress, based on current trends and a set of predefined
projection speeds. It generates interpolated yearly projections from
the latest available data point up to a given target year, filtering
for progress scenarios that either increase or decrease the indicator
as specified.
